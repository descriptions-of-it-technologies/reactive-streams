## Reactive Streams API
* Goal is to create a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.
* Reactive Streams started in 2013 by engineers from Netflix, Pivotal, Lightbend (formerly Typesafe), Red Hat, Twitter, and Oracle.
* Reactive Streams is a set of 4 interfaces which define the API
* When systems exchange continuous streams of data, the classical producer/consumer problems arise. It is especially 
  important to provide back-pressure mechanisms so that a consumer can notify a producer when it is emitting too fast. 
  With reactive streams (www.reactive-streams.org), the main goal is to reach the best throughput between systems.
